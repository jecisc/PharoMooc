${slide:title=Really?!|label=really}$

- No primitive types
- No hardcoded constructs for conditional
- Only messages
- Only objects

- and this works?
- I mean really?
- Not even slow?
- Can't be real!

${slide:title=Motto}$

- Let's open our eyes, look, understand, and deeply understand the underlying design aspects of object-oriented programming.


*@really*

*TEST !>@really*

${slide:title=Booleans}$

[[[language=smalltalk 
3 > 0
	ifTrue: ['positive']
	ifFalse: ['negative']
-> 'positive'
]]]

${slide:title=Yes ifTrue\:ifFalse\: is a message!}$

[[[language=smalltalk 
Weather isRaining
	ifTrue: [self takeMyUmbrella]
	ifFalse: [self takeMySunglasses]
]]]

- Conceptually ==ifTrue:ifFalse:== is a message sent to an object: a boolean!
- ==ifTrue:ifFalse:== is in fact radically optimized by the compiler but you can implement another one such ==siAlors:sinon:== and check. 

${slide:title=Booleans}$

In Pharo booleans have nothing special
- & | not
- or: and: (lazy)
- xor:
- ifTrue:ifFalse:
- ifFalse:ifTrue:
- ...

! Exercices
${toc:depthLevel=1|level=0|highlight=1}$

!! Exercise 1: Implement not

${slide:title=Exercise 1\: Implement not}$

- Propose an implementation of not in a world where you do not have Booleans.
- You only have objects and messages.
[[[language=smalltalk 
false not 
	-> true

true not 
	-> false
]]]

!!Exercise 2: Implement | (Or) ifTrue: ifFalse:

${toc:depthLevel=2|level=0|highlight=1}$

${slide:title=Exercise 2\: Implement \| (Or)}$

- Propose an implementation of or in a world where you do not have Booleans.
- You only have objects and messages.

[[[language=smalltalk 
	true | true -> true
	true | false -> true
	true | anything -> true

	false | true -> true
	false | false -> false
	false | anything -> anything
]]]

${slide:title=Exercise2\: Variation - Implement ifTrue\:ifFalse\:}$

- Propose an implementation of not in a world where you do not have Booleans.
- You only have objects, messages and closures.

[[[language=smalltalk 
false ifTrue: [ 3 ] ifFalse: [ 5 ]
-> 5
true ifTrue: [ 3 ] ifFalse: [ 5 ]
-> 3
]]]

! Boolean Implementation

${toc:depthLevel=1|level=0|highlight=1}$

${slide:title=Booleans Implementation Hint One}$

- The solution does not use conditionals 
- else we would obtain a recursive definition of ==ifTrue:ifFalse:==

${slide:title=Boolean Implementation Hint Two}$

- The solution uses three classes: ==Boolean==, ==True== and ==False==
- ==false== and ==true== are unique instances described by their own classes 
- ==false== is an instance of the class ==False==
- ==true== is an instance of the class ==True==

${slide:title=How do we express choice in OOP?}$

- We send messages to objects

[[[language=smalltalk 
	aButton color
	-> Color red
	
	aPane color
	-> Color blue
	
	aWindow color
	-> Color grey
]]]

- Let's the receiver decide

- Do not ask, tell

${slide:title=Boolean not implementation}$

- Class ==Boolean== is an abstract class that implements behavior common to true and false. Its subclasses are ==True== and ==False==. 
Subclasses must implement methods for logical operations ==&==, ==not==, and controls ==and:==, ==or:==, ==ifTrue:==, ==ifFalse:==, ==ifTrue:ifFalse:==, ==ifFalse:ifTrue:==

[[[language=smalltalk
Boolean>>not
	"Negation. Answer true if the receiver is false, answer false if the receiver is true."
	self subclassResponsibility
]]]

${slide:title=Not implementation in two methods}$

[[[language=smalltalk 
False>>not
	"Negation -- answer true since the receiver is false."
	^ true
]]]

[[[language=smalltalk 
True>>not
	"Negation--answer false since the receiver is true."
	^ false
]]]

[[[language=smalltalk 
	
	true | true -> true
	true | false -> true
	true | anything -> true

	false | true -> true

	false | anything -> anything

]]]

${slide:title=Boolean>> \| aBoolean}$

	Boolean>> | aBoolean
		"Evaluating disjunction (OR). Evaluate the argument. Answer true if either the receiver or the argument is
true."
	self subclassResponsibility
]]]

${slide:title=False>> \| aBoolean}$

[[[language=smalltalk

false | false -> false
false | anything -> anything
]]]

[[[language=smalltalk

	"Evaluating disjunction (OR) -- answer with the argument, aBoolean."
	^ aBoolean 
]]]

${slide:title=True>> \| aBoolean}$

[[[language=smalltalk

true | false -> true
true | anything -> true
]]]

[[[language=smalltalk

	"Evaluating disjunction (OR) -- answer true since the receiver is true."

${slide:title=Implementing ifTrue\:ifFalse\:}$

- Do you see the pattern?
- Remember that a closure freezes execution and that value launches the execution of a frozen code.

[[[language=smalltalk 
True>>ifTrue: aTrueBlock ifFalse: aFalseBlock
	^ aTrueBlock value
]]]

[[[language=smalltalk 
False>>ifTrue: aTrueBlock ifFalse: aFalseBlock
	^ aFalseBlock value
]]]

${slide:title=Implementation Note}$

- Note that the Virtual Machine shortcuts calls to boolean such as condition for speed reason.
- But you can implement your own conditional method and debug to see that sending a message is dispatching to the right object.

! So what ?

${toc:depthLevel=1|level=0|highlight=1}$

${slide:title=Ok so what?}$

- You will probably not implement another Boolean classes
- So is it really that totally useless?


${slide:title=Message sends act as case statements}$

- The execution engine will select the right method in the class of the receiver
- The case statements is dynamic in the sense that it depends on the classes loaded and the objects to which the message is sent.
- Each time you send a message, the system will select the method corresponding to the receiver.


${slide:title=A Class Hierarchy is a Skeleton for Dynamic Dispatch}$

- If we would have said that the ==Boolean== would be composed of only one class, we could not have use dynamic binding.
- A class hierarchy is the exoskeleton for dynamic binding

- Compare the solution with one class vs. a hierarchy.

+One single class vs. a nice hierarchy.>file://figures/Design-FatVsDispatch.png|width=70+

- The hierarchy provides a way to specialize behavior.
- It is also more declarative in the sense that you only focus on one class.
- It is more modular in the sense that you can package different classes in different packages.

${slide:title=Avoid Conditionals}$

- Use objects and messages, when you can
- The execution engine acts as a conditional switch: Use it!
- Check the AntiIfCampaign.

${slide:title=Follow-up: Implement ternary logic}$

- Boolean: ==true==, ==false==, ==unknown==
